## My process

1. **Implementing Semantic HTML and BEM Naming**

While building the HTML structure, I focused on keeping it semantic and accessible.  
At first, I used `<th>` for both the nutrition names and values to emphasize the numbers, but later realized it wasn’t correct — only the row headers should use `<th>`. I also learned the importance of adding `scope="row"` for accessibility.  

For BEM naming, I initially used section-specific classes like `recipe-card__nutrition-title` or `recipe-card__instructions-title`, but that limited reusability. I refactored them into a shared class, `recipe-card__sub-title`, which keeps the code cleaner and easier to scale.
